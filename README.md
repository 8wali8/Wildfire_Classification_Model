wildfire cause prediction model made for the chabot space and science center enviro team

model.py contains all of the model code, data pre/post processing is pretty self-explanatory

to run it yourself, download FER dataset, run data pre, run model, run data post, upload data to ARCgis to plot and generalize results

model ended with around 70% accuracy using random forest, increased from around 40% using neural network and too many classifers.

used FER wildfire dataset with all US wildfires

in future, plan to generalize more and add a CNN to include "terrain" feature for more accuracy
