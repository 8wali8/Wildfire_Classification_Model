wildfire cause prediction model made for the chabot space and science center enviro team

model.py contains all of the code, pretty messy, includes 1. data preprocessing 2. model training 3. prediction solving all in one file, should have seperated but that was too much work

model ended with around 70% accuracy using random forest, increased from around 40% using neural network and too many classifers.

used FER wildfire dataset with all US wildfires

in future, plan to generalize more and add a CNN to include "terrain" feature for more accuracy
